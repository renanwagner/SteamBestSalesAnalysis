# 🎮 Steam Best-Selling Games Data Analysis

This project focuses on **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, **exploratory analysis**, **correlation mapping**, and **basic statistical modeling** of best-selling games available on the Steam platform. The analysis aims to uncover relationships between variables such as price, downloads, ratings, tags, generation, and revenue.

## 📁 Project Structure

### `treatment.py`
This script is responsible for **cleaning and preparing the general dataset** (`bestSelling_games.csv`) for analysis. It includes:

- Parsing and extracting fields from the release date.
- Creating new features like:
  - `generation` (based on console release periods),
  - `main_tag` (first tag),
  - `main_feature` (first listed feature).
- Scaling numerical values using **MinMaxScaler**.
- Label encoding categorical variables (`developer`, `tag`, `feature`, `OS`).
- Computing derived metrics such as `total_revenue_million`.
- Converting reviews/downloads to thousands for readability.
- Saving the treated dataset to `bestSelling_treated.csv`.

---

### `treatment_receipt.py`
This script performs the **same treatment pipeline** as `treatment.py`, but **filters only the games with non-zero revenue** before proceeding.

- It creates a version of the dataset that includes **only financially successful games**.
- This allows focused analysis on **monetized titles**.
- The output is saved as `bestSelling_treated_receipt.csv`.

---

### `basic_math_statistics.py`
Performs **statistical modeling and linear regression** based on the full dataset (`bestSelling_treated.csv`). It includes:

- Multiple regressions to explore:
  - Downloads prediction from review metrics.
  - Correlation between critic and user ratings.
  - Price vs. duration and other features.
- Calculation of:
  - **R² score** to assess model performance.
  - **RMSE** to evaluate model error.
- Conclusions and interpretations for business relevance (e.g., generation-year correlation, pricing trends).

> 📌 This script is **exploratory** and does not change the dataset.

---

### `basic_math_statistics_receipt.py`
A receipt-specific version of the regression script:

- Uses `bestSelling_treated_receipt.csv` as input.
- Repeats the regressions but **removes free or zero-revenue games**.
- Helps to eliminate bias from non-monetized products and sharpen revenue-based insights.

---

### `visualization.py`
Generates a wide variety of **static visualizations** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:

- **Histograms** for price, downloads, rating, etc.
- **Count plots** for year and generation distributions.
- **Correlation heatmaps** between scaled variables.
- **Boxplots** and **violin plots** for rating, price, revenue per genre/generation.
- **Crosstab heatmaps** for year vs tag, feature, and age restriction.
- **Scatter plots** showing price vs downloads, and other relationships.

These visualizations are essential for understanding trends and relationships in the full dataset.

---

### `visualization_receipt.py`
A specialized version of the `visualization.py` script that uses only **games with non-zero revenue**:

- Helps visualize market patterns more realistically.
- Highlights pricing, downloads, and revenue trends for monetized games.
- Useful for business analysis and identifying potential outliers or top performers.

## 📦 Dataset

### `bestSelling_games.csv`
The **original dataset** containing all games, with fields such as:

- `game_name`, `price`, `rating`, `length`, `estimated_downloads`, `reviews_like_rate`, `release_date`, `user_defined_tags`, etc.

### `bestSelling_treated.csv`
The **cleaned and feature-engineered version** of the dataset produced by `treatment.py`.

- Includes new columns such as `total_revenue_million`, `generation`, `main_tag`, `main_feature`, and MinMax-scaled features.

### `bestSelling_treated_receipt.csv`
A **filtered version** of the treated dataset containing only games with a revenue greater than 0.

- Generated by `treatment_receipt.py`.
- Designed for focused financial and business analysis.
